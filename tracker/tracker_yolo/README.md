# YOLO Ball Tracker

The tracker uses the pretrained [YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) models for the ball detection as well as the pose detection.

The different approach includes training the YOLO model on a custom dataset, created from an already existing dataset. Thanks to (rasmusakerlund)[@rasmusakerlund] for providing the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rasmuspeterakerlund/balls-and-hands-in-videos-of-juggling).
